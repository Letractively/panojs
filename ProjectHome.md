PanoJS is an interactive JavaScript widget for panning and zooming a panoramic image stitched together dynamically from smaller tiles. This widget can be used for viewing images that are larger than the available space in the browser viewport. Examples include maps or high resolution document scans.

Check out this [demo](http://www.mojavelinux.com/cooker/demos/gsv/) to see PanoJS in action.

PanoJS has gone through a couple of name changes. It was first named GSV2 when it was released as the next generation of the Giant Ass Image Viewer originally developed by Michal Migurski. It was then briefly known as GSIV and finally became PanoJS when it became a Google Code project.

[ZoomifyAJAX](http://www.staremapy.cz/zoomifyjs/) is an adaptation of this library.
[PanoJS](http://www.dimin.net/software/panojs) itself has been moved to a new home.
